# Section 2: Getting Started with Java Spring Framework - 1 - Create Maven Project

## What is the purpose of the Group ID and Artifact ID when creating a Spring project?
- They function similarly to a package name and class name, respectively, and help in uniquely identifying the project.

## Why should you avoid using Snapshot versions when creating a Spring project?
- Snapshot versions are unstable and may break the build.


# Section 3: 

## What is tight coupling in the context of software design?
- Tight coupling is a design issue where classes are highly dependent on each other, making it difficult to modify or extend the code without affecting other parts of the system.

## Why is the GameRunner class described as tightly coupled in the provided example?
- The GameRunner class is tightly coupled because it directly depends on the specific implementation of the GamingConsole interface, rather than on an abstraction.

## What is the primary disadvantage of tight coupling?
- Tight coupling makes it difficult to modify or extend the code without affecting other parts of the system.

## Why is loose coupling generally preferred in software design?
- Loose coupling allows for easier modification or extension of the code without affecting other parts of the system.
